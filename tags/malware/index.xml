      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, one of my friends sent me a challenge in the reverse engineering field. In the beginning, I was busy and I could not work on this challenge. But one thing caught my eye. And it was a binary compressed using UPX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to decompress that with the UPX program but it did not work. so I created a new binary and compared them in hexdump view. several parts related to UPX headers had changed. The bad news was that I had no idea about the headers of this program. but As you know, there is always good news among bad news :). The UPX is an Open Source Program and we can check the codes.&lt;/p&gt;
